# ðŸ“Œ Clean Code Reflections

## When Should You Add Comments?

- When there is complex logic that is not explanatory.
- When you need to explain why you took a shortcut or non-obvious approach.
- To provide documentation for function arguments, expected input/output, and purpose.

## When Should You Avoid Comments?

- When the code can be explained by itself with improved naming or refactoring.
- When the comment simply repeats what the code is explaining.
- If it will soon be obsolete and cause confusion.

Cleanly written code should stand on its own as documentation, and comments only augment it, not hide bad design.
