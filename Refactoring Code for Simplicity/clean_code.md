# ðŸ“Œ Clean Code Reflections

## What Made the Original Code Complex?

- Nested conditional logic made it hard to follow.
- Repetitive calculations increased the risk of errors.
- The function tried to handle too many things at once.

## How Did Refactoring Improve It?

- Broke down logic into smaller, reusable functions.
- Eliminated redundant code, improving maintainability.
- Made the function more readable and easier to test.
