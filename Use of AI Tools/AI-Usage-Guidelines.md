# ü§ñ Use of AI Tools

## üîç Research & Learn

**1. What AI tools are typically used for your role?**

- **GitHub Copilot** ‚Äì Offers coding recommendations, auto-completion, and debugging support.
- **ChatGPT/Bard** ‚Äì Helps with code explanations, documentation, and debugging.
- **Tabnine** ‚Äì AI-enabled code completion.
- **ReSharper** ‚Äì Expands code quality and refactoring in C#.
- **Power Automate** ‚Äì Automates process workflow and repetitive tasks.

**2. What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?**

‚úÖ **Benefits:**

- Increases efficiency by automating repetitive coding tasks.
- Helps with debugging and finding optimal solutions.
- Enhances learning by providing real-time explanations.
- Assists in documentation and report generation.

‚ö† **Risks:**

- Over-reliance can reduce problem-solving skills.
- AI-generated code may contain security vulnerabilities.
- Entering confidential information risks **data leaks**.
- AI may give incorrect or biased responses.

**3. What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?**

- **Internal company data** (client details, internal project data, login credentials).
- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** (names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses).
- **Proprietary source code** (unless the tool is cleared for secure use).
- **Security-sensitive data** (API tokens, passwords, internal system layout).

**4. How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?**

- **Cross-check sources** prior to believing AI-created information.
- **Test AI-generated code** in a secure environment prior to deployment.
- **Check security & logic** to ensure AI output aligns with best practices.
- **Verify through authoritative documents** (Microsoft Docs, Stack Overflow).

## üìù Reflection

**1. When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?**

Use AI for:

- ‚úî Code suggestions, auto-completion, and debugging.
- ‚úî Generating boilerplate code to save time.
- ‚úî Researching new frameworks or best practices.
- ‚úî Assisting in documentation and report writing.

Rely on personal skills for:

- ‚úî Critical thinking and complex problem-solving.
- ‚úî Security-sensitive code and logic validation.
- ‚úî Designing system architecture and business logic.
- ‚úî Ultimate decision-making and project planning.

**2. How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?**

- Use AI **as a guide**, not as a definitive response.
- Always **review, test, and refine AI-generated content** before using it.
- Practice **manual problem-solving** to maintain coding skills.
- Carry out **peer reviews** to verify AI-assisted work.

**3. What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?**

- Avoid feeding sensitive information to AI systems.
- Use **offline/local AI models** for sensitive tasks.
- Check AI tool **privacy policies** prior to use.
- Anonymize and encrypt the information if AI processing is required.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

**1. Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.**

- Used **GitHub Copilot** to optimize a repetitive C# function.
- Manually reviewed and **refactored the AI suggestion** to improve efficiency.
- Verified the changes using unit tests.

**2. Review the AI-generated output critically‚Äîdid it require editing or fact-checking?**

- Required **manual optimization** to align with project standards.
- AI provided **useful but not perfect** suggestions.

**3. Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.**

**"Always validate AI-generated code and documentation before integrating it into production."**
