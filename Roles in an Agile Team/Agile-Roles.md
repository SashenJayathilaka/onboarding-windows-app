# 🚩 Roles in an Agile Team

## 🔍 Research & Learn

**1. What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?**

- _Developers_

  - Responsible for coding, programming, testing, and maintaining the software.
  - They work together to execute the features as described in the user stories and engage in sprint planning, daily standup, and retrospectives.

- _QA (Quality Assurance)_

  - Installs measures that ensure the product is free of defects and meets the acceptance criteria.
  - They perform manual or automated testing, write bugs, and provide feedback on the software's quality.

- _Product Manager (PM)_

  - The Product Manager owns the product vision and ensuring that the right features are being built for the customer.
  - They prefer the product backlog and collaborate extensively with the development team to create requirements and user stories.

- _Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)_

  - Supports the Agile processes so that the team adopts the Scrum or Kanban methods efficiently.
  - They pave the way for the team, schedule sprint planning, standup, and retrospectives, and track progress.

- _Other supporting roles (e.g., stakeholders, UX, customer support)_

  - Stakeholders: Provide input on product development and make sure that the product aligns with business goals.
  - UX/UI Designers: Design user interfaces and provide a great user experience.
  - Customer Support: Provides user input and issue feedback to guide product development.

2. **How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?**

| **Kanban**                                                                                                    | **Scrum**                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Roles in Kanban are less formal and team members have different responsibilities based on work flow.          | Roles are more formal in Scrum with Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and the development team all having specific roles.                  |
| There is continuous delivery, so coordination takes place on a pull basis with work being finished as needed. | Sprints are used to manage time-boxed work, with the teams more formally collaborating in sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives. |
| Developers and QA collaborate more closely and communication takes place less formally.                       | QA often collaborates with developers to provide quality at every level, and there is formal feedback in sprint review.                 |

## 📝 Reflection

1. **What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?**

   - As a Windows Application Developer, my contributions include writing, testing, and maintaining code of the Windows application. I do it in accordance with Agile principles so that the software is incrementally developed and iteratively refined to provide features that bring value to the customer in each sprint.

2. **How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?**

   - My job crosses over with QA when we work together to ensure that the features that I build are adequately tested before they are released.
   - There is also duplication with the Product Manager, especially in the definition of the feature requirements and user stories to ensure that the product will meet the customer's requirement.

## 🛠️ Task

1. **Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.**

   - As a Windows Application Developer, I am responsible for coding, testing, and deploying the code that makes up the application. This entails working with UI components, business logic, and ensuring there is seamless interaction between different layers of the application. I follow Agile principles to deliver user stories in iterations, collaborating with other team members to achieve sprint goals.

2. **Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.**

   - One of the roles that I work hand in hand with is QA (Quality Assurance). We check that the application is performing as expected and adheres to the acceptance criteria laid out by the Product Manager. To improve teamwork with QA, I can provide good documentation and help with test cases, so that the features are tested early and continuously during the sprint. This will reduce last-minute bugs and improve the quality of the application overall.
