1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

   - Focus Bear is one-of-a-kind in the sense that it is the integration of **habit tracking, distraction blocking, and structured routines** within a single app. While others block distractions (Freedom, Cold Turkey) or plan habits and routines (Tiimo, Routinery), **Focus Bear merges the two for a more integrated approach to productivity.**

2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

   - **All-in-One Solution:** Focus Bear doesn't just block distractions like Freedom or Cold Turkey—it also helps with habit-building and workflow organization.
   - **Automation & Personalization:** It is extremely customizable, allowing users to personalize focus sessions and routines.
   - **Adaptive Productivity:** The app supports different modes for work, breaks, and relaxation, making it more adaptive compared to rigid time-blocking apps.

3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

   - **"Scheduled App Blocking" in Cold Turkey & Freedom.**
     These apps allow for the pre-scheduling of specific time blocks when apps/websites will be automatically blocked, whereas Focus Bear works mostly in real-time.

4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

   - **"More advanced blocking personalization."**
     Adding **scheduled app blocking** and **conditional access (e.g., permit certain websites only for work purposes)** would make Focus Bear even more powerful for users needing strong focus restrictions.
