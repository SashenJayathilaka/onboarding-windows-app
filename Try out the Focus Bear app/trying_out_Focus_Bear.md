# ðŸ“Œ First-Time User Experience Assignment

1. What was your first impression of the app?

   - The app has a **clean and minimalistic interface**, making it easy to navigate. The onboarding process provides a good understanding of how Focus Bear works, but some sections can be simplified for better clarity.

2. Did you find anything difficult to understand?

   - The **installation process at first** wasn't as straightforward as it might have been. There were settings which weren't fully explained, and therefore I had a bit of a puzzle in understanding the ideal settings for myself.
   - The **notifications and reminders** weren't necessarily straightforward initiallyâ€”some method of prompting about the configuration would be a nice touch.

3. If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?

   - _"Focus Bear keeps you on task by blocking distractions, guiding your workflow, and developing better focus habits with disciplined routines."_

4. What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?

   - **Easier onboarding steps:** A quick tutorial or tour would tell new users how to install and customize Focus Bear.
   - **Recommended setup interactions:** Instead of requiring manual configuration, the app may provide **predefined modes** based on user preference (e.g., "Deep Work Mode" vs. "Balanced Mode").
   - **More visual feedback:** Features for monitoring progress or gamification may provide more feedback.
   - **More helpful permission descriptions:** Some required permissions (e.g., notifications, accessibility settings) could have more specific reasons for why they are needed.

## âœ… Next Steps

- **Will continue to experiment with the app** and provide further feedback as I use it more.
