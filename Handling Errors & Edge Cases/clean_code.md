# ðŸ“Œ Clean Code Reflections

## What Was the Problem with the Original Code?

The original `divide` function lacked input validation and division by zero checks.
This would result in silent failures or erroneous behavior (e.g., NaN, Infinity).

## How Does Error Handling Make Things More Reliable?

- Prevents invalid operations like division by zero.
- Makes the application crash early and clearly, rather than quietly producing the wrong output.
- Enables debugging and stabilizes the program.
- Guard clauses simplify code readability by handling edge cases first.
