# 📌 Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks

## 🔍 Research & Learn

1. **What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?**

   - Agile is a flexible, iterative project and software development technique that emphasizes collaboration, customer involvement, and incessant improvement. It is opposed to traditional project management (like Waterfall), whose process is linear and sequential with rigorous planning. Agile facilitates flexibility, frequent reassessment, and incremental development and hence is suited for environments that change frequently.

2. **What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)**

   - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

   - Working software over comprehensive documentation

   - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

   - Responding to change over following a plan

3. What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

| **Aspect**     | **Scrum**                                                              | **Kanban**                                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Structure**  | Formal roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team)           | No fixed roles, focuses on continuous flow             |
| **Iterations** | Fixed length Sprints (1-4 weeks)                                       | Continuous flow with no fixed iterations               |
| **Artifacts**  | Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Burndown Charts                       | Kanban Board, Work in Progress (WIP) limits            |
| **Best For**   | Teams that need structure, time-boxed planning, and clear deliverables | Teams that require flexibility and continuous delivery |

4. **Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?**

   - Focus Bear favors Kanban over Scrum due to its flexibility and emphasis on continuous flow. This allows the team to manage tasks dynamically, adapt to changing priorities, and maintain a steady workflow without the strict overhead of time-boxed sprints. It allows better visualization of work in progress and helps to constrain bottlenecks, which aligns with the team's goal of delivering incremental and consistent improvements.

## 📝 Reflection

1.  **What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?**

    ### Benefits:

    - Smaller feedback loops improve product quality.

    - Encourages collaboration and responsiveness.

    - Reduces risk with small, incremental deliveries.

    ### Challenges:

    - Requires very high team participation and communication.

    - Difficult to manage when priorities constantly change.

    - Requires good leadership to impose Agile principles properly.

2.  **How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?**

    - As a Windows application developer, Agile principles like iterative improvement and continuous feedback enable quick reaction to new problems. By emphasizing the creation of small, useful increments, I enhance productivity, am able to handle workloads more effectively, and respond well to changing requirements.

## 🛠️ Task

1. **Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.**

   - Scrum is a structured, time-boxed method with Sprints and Roles and hence is well suited to teams with clear deadlines. Kanban is a flexible, continuous-flow method and hence is well suited to teams like Focus Bear that must be responsive.

2. **Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.**

   - "Adjusting to change rather than following a plan." This is vital because flexibility means we can always go back and improve, unlike following a set plan that may be outdated.
