# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## üîç Research & Learn

1. **How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?**

- A Kanban board is a visual tool utilized in Agile to effectively track and manage workflow. It helps teams view work, identify bottlenecks, and improve efficiency by limiting work in progress (WIP). The board has multiple columns of different stages of work, and the tasks are moved from left to right as they progress.

2. **What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)**

| **Backlog (To Do)**                     | List of all tasks that need to be completed but are not yet started. |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **In Progress (Doing)**                 | Tasks that are currently being worked on.                            |
| **Blocked**                             | Tasks that cannot progress due to dependencies or issues.            |
| **Review (Testing, Code Review, etc.)** | Tasks that need verification before completion.                      |
| **Done**                                | Completed tasks that meet the definition of done (DoD).              |

3. **How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?**

- Team members move tasks from one column to another as work progresses.
- Developers, QA, Product Managers, and other team members update tasks based on their responsibilities.
- Tasks should not be moved without meeting the required criteria for that stage (e.g., code reviews before deployment).

4. **What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?**

- > ‚úî Tasks are completed faster rather than being stuck in progress.
- > ‚úî Teams focus on priority work instead of spreading effort thin.
- > ‚úî Bottlenecks are easily identified and resolved.
- > ‚úî Overall workflow is smoother, preventing task overload.

## üìù Reflection

1. How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

- Seeing Work: Kanban provides an open, real-time window into work and makes high-impact work readily prioritable.
- Work in Progress (WIP) Limiting: By capping the level of work in progress, Kanban prevents overload and multitasking.
- Identifying Bottlenecks: If there are too many tasks accumulated in one column (e.g., "In Progress" or "Blocked"), then the team can address issues on time before production gets slow.
- Continuous Flow: Unlike Scrum, in Kanban, tasks can advance separately so that the work can move ahead without depending on the sprint cycles.

2.  How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

- Establish WIP Limits: Avoid overwhelming yourself by capping the quantity of work that you do simultaneously.
- Prioritize High-Priority Tasks: Always focus on high-impact and urgency tasks first.
- Regularly Update the Board: Let your work reflect real progress to uphold high transparency.
- Identify and Resolve Blockers Early: If a task is in the "Blocked" column, escalate the issue or reassign work to keep momentum going.
- Use Retrospectives for Optimization: Periodically reflect on the workflow to streamline processes and get rid of inefficiencies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

1. Check out Focus Bear‚Äôs Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. (Hint: Look in GitHub Projects.)

- Navigate to GitHub Projects and discover the Kanban board.
- Notice how tasks are labeled (Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Review, Done).
- Notice labels, assignees, and priority levels.

2. Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.

- Select a task that has been assigned to you and alter its progress (e.g., from "In Progress" to "Review" or "Done").
- Ensure that the task is compliant with all requirements prior to submitting it to the next stage (e.g., code review, testing).

3. Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.

- Example: Use more informative task descriptions and break down large tasks into small, manageable sub-tasks.
- Why? This is truer to tracking progress and prevents last-minute scrambles at deadlines.
- A further area for improvement might be adding estimated completion times so that delivery and workload can be forecasted more accurately.
