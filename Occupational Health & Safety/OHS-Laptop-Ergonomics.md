## **🔍 Research & Learn**

**1. What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?**

- Neck and Shoulder Strain – The laptop screen is usually too low, causing forward head posture.
- Wrist and Hand Pain – Built-in keyboards can cause awkward wrist angles.
- Eye Strain and Fatigue – Staring at a small screen can lead to digital eye strain.
- Poor Posture – Hunching over a laptop can cause long-term musculoskeletal issues.

**2. What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop? (e.g., laptop stands, external keyboards, ergonomic chairs)**

- Laptop Stand – Raises the screen to eye level, reducing neck strain.
- External Keyboard and Mouse – Allows a more natural hand and wrist position.
- Ergonomic Chair – Supports proper spinal alignment and posture.
- Monitor Arm or External Monitor – Helps keep the screen at a comfortable height.

**3. What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?**

- Monitor Height – The top of the screen should be at eye level.
- Chair Position – Feet should be flat on the floor, knees at a 90-degree angle.
- Desk Setup – Keep elbows at a 90-degree angle and wrists in a neutral position.
- Lighting – Use soft lighting to reduce glare and eye strain.

**4. What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? (e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)**

- Follow the 20-20-20 Rule – Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
- Take Movement Breaks – Stand up and stretch every 30–60 minutes.
- Posture Checks – Set reminders to sit upright with relaxed shoulders.
- Hydration and Nutrition – Stay hydrated to reduce fatigue and maintain focus.

## **📝 Reflection**

**1. What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)**

- Using a Laptop Stand – Raises the screen to eye level.
- Adding an External Keyboard and Mouse – Encourages a more natural wrist position.
